Overview of the project:
project: StudentGradeTracker
The program is designed to track students' names and their corresponding grades. It continuously prompts the user to input student data until the user chooses to exit. Afterward, the program calculates and displays the average grade for all students.

Key Features:
1. Student and Grade Input:
   - The user is prompted to enter each student’s name and grade.
   - The input continues in a loop until the user types 'exit' to stop entering more students.
   
2. Grade Validation:
   - The program uses a try-catch block to ensure that the entered grade is valid (i.e., a number). If invalid input is detected (such as entering text instead of a number), the program re-prompts the user to input the grade correctly.

3. Average Grade Calculation:
   - The program calculates the average grade by summing all student grades and dividing by the total number of students.

4. Result Display:
   - After collecting all student names and grades, the program displays each student’s name alongside their grade.
   - It also displays the overall average grade for all students.

Main Components:
1. List Management:
   - List<String> students: A list to store the names of all students.
   - List<Double> grades: A list to store the grades corresponding to each student.
   
2. Loop for Data Entry:
   - The program uses a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user to enter student names and grades until 'exit' is typed.
   
3. Grade Validation:
   - A try-catch block ensures that only valid numeric grades are accepted. If invalid input is entered, the user is asked to input a valid grade again.
